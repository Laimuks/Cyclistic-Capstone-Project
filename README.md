# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project
This capstone project is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. 
In this case study I analyzed a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. 
I used R programming language for this analysis, because of its easy statistical analysis tools and data visualizations.
